# Bundled CU Viewer files

This directory contains the complete production browser page used by the Go
extension. It is not an npm consumer, a separate Go module, or a runtime cache.
Only the page, assets and licenses are embedded; this README and Go source are
not served to the browser.

## Current source

- Repository: cu-viewer.
- Source commit: `16a867f6aa80d96a41b4231da781f50a5c17fd85`.
- Frontend package version: `0.0.0` (local preview source, not a published npm dependency).
- Build command: `npm run build:viewer`.
- Imported on: 2026-11-05.
- Payload: 225 plain files, including the root licenses.

This copy uses the committed Viewer UI. The pending single-toolbar changes in
the separate cu-viewer working tree are deliberately not included.

## Manual updates

1. Select a reviewed cu-viewer source revision and build its production page.
2. Copy the complete contents of `dist-app` here, including all JS/CSS chunks,
   PDF workers/fonts/CMaps/ICC/WASM and HEIF workers/decoder files.
3. Copy that source revision's `LICENSE` as `LICENSE.txt`, and its
   `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` unchanged.
4. Preserve `embed.go` and this README. Replace the generated `assets` subtree
   as a complete set rather than leaving obsolete hashed chunks behind.
5. Update the source revision above, run the extension's tests and rebuild it.

Node/npm are needed only for the producer's frontend build. The extension
needs neither Node, npm nor Python to build or run after these files are supplied.
There is no downloader, ZIP extraction, resource cache or automatic update.

The extension's [Git ignore rules](../.gitignore) explicitly include this static
directory's `assets/pdfjs/build` runtime files. Other build outputs remain
ignored. Include `assets/pdfjs/build/pdf.worker.mjs` with normal `git add`
when updating the static page; no forced add is needed.

The extension's [Git attributes](../.gitattributes) preserve the compiled
payload byte-for-byte, including vendor notices. The Go wrapper and this README
remain normal LF text files with standard whitespace checks.
